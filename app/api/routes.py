# Two-tier lock: an OS file-lock for cross-worker serialisation + an
# in-process boolean for cross-coroutine serialisation within a single
# worker.
#
# Why both: Linux flock(2) is per-open-file-description, NOT per-process.
# So two open() calls in the same process produce different OFDs, and
# flock() on each succeeds — within one worker, multiple concurrent
# coroutines could each open the file, lock it, and proceed in parallel.
# Surfaced 2026-04-30 evening when 9 rapid-fire triggerCompetition calls
# resulted in 3 leagues running concurrently with deadlock retries on
# shared player_projections / model_dataset writes.
#
# Originally the code used a Python module global `_projection_running`,
# replaced 2026-04-24 with the file lock alone after a 2-worker incident
# corrupted fixture_team_stats.csv. The replacement was an over-correction
# — the file lock handles cross-worker, but you ALSO need an in-process
# guard. Restored 2026-04-30.
#
# flock is held by the kernel for the FD that owns the file handle, so
# it's truly cross-process. Released automatically if the worker crashes
# (kernel closes FD), so no zombie-lock risk. The in-process boolean is
# safe because asyncio coroutines only context-switch at await points,
# and _try_acquire_lock has no awaits — so the check + set is atomic.
