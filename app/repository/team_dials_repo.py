"""
Repo for the projections_team_dials table — per-team Attack / Defence
overrides set by an admin operator in the Projections Admin Console.

Each row is a (competition_id, team_id) override. Values are signed
percentage adjustments (-50..+50) applied to the team's Attack and/or
Defence rating during projection. A row with both adjustments at 0 is
deleted by the Laravel controller, so any row returned here is by
definition "active".

Applied after the market-value adjustment but before the rescale-to-
mean=100 step, so dialled teams shift the league mean and other teams'
indexed values drift naturally. Two call sites today:

  - projection_service._prepare_league() for single-league projections.
  - euro_comp_projection_service._project() per inner domestic league
    in the cross-league rating set — propagates a team's dial to its
    appearances in CL / Europa / Conf League ratings too.
