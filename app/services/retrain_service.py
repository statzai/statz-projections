"""
Phase 4: weekly model retraining — dry-run mode.

Iterates every (league, stat) pair, trains a fresh PoissonRegressor on
the DB-sourced training data (projection_model_dataset, populated by
Phase 2 dual-write + Phase 3 reads), writes the .sav to a versioned path,
and INSERTs a row in projection_models with is_active=0.

For each (league, stat) ALSO logs what the promotion decision WOULD be
against the current incumbent, using the guardrail in
_decide_promotion(). Phase 4 does NOT actually promote — that's Phase 5.
Purpose of dry-run: observe week-over-week MAE variance for 3–4 cycles
so the 2%/10% thresholds can be tuned empirically before promotion goes
live.

Also trains the "All Leagues" fallback models (competition_id=NULL rows)
by training on every row in projection_model_dataset, regardless of
league.

Called from /api/retrain endpoint (routes.py). Not yet scheduled — Phase
5 adds the weekly cron on Laravel's Kernel.
