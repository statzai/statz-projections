"""
Single source of truth for which stat_types the projection pipeline reads
from `fixture_team_stats` and `fixture_player_stats`.

Why this module exists
----------------------
Before 2026-04-30, the LeagueDataLoader pulled every row from those tables
(all ~1,116 stat_types) and the projection code filtered at use time.
That wasted ~70% of the loaded volume. Worse, `team_stats` was scoped to
in-league fixtures only, which broke share calculations for transferred
players whose history is at out-of-scope clubs (Souza-style NaN-guard).

This file is the contract: every stat name listed here gets pulled from
the DB. If projection code references a stat NOT listed here, the loader
won't fetch its rows and the share calc will silently return 0 — exactly
the behaviour Flavour B teams (Barcelona/Lecce/etc.) were exhibiting.

How to add a stat
-----------------
1. Add the human-readable name to TEAM_STAT_NAMES and/or PLAYER_STAT_NAMES.
   Names must match `stats_types.name` exactly (case-sensitive).
2. Add the corresponding code that consumes it (the get_stat_id() lookups
   in statz_functions.py, etc.).
3. Redeploy. Loader picks up the new entry on next projection run.

How to remove a stat
--------------------
1. Remove all code references first (search the codebase for the stat name).
2. Then remove from this list. Order matters — if you remove from the list
   first, code still referencing it falls through to fillna(0) and projects
   zeros silently.

Fail-fast guard
---------------
resolve_stat_ids() raises if any name doesn't match a `stats_types` row.
The loader calls it at startup, so typos and DB drift surface immediately
instead of producing zero-filled projections.
