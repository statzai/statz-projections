"""
World Cup 2026 fixture projections.

Self-contained — ratings AND projections are both refreshed every run,
mirroring the domestic projection pattern.

Score prediction is the **same code path as domestic** (calls the shared
get_result_probs + find_inputs_for_probs helpers in statz_functions).
The only differences are the ratings source (international_ratings rather
than the domestic get_ratings pipeline) and the per-fixture lambda
construction (single AVG_GOALS + host bonus, no league-specific weightings).

Pipeline:
1. Compute fresh Statz international ratings (TEB v5 FIFA opp + MV v8
   nudge + symmetric caps) for today's date, committing to team_ratings.
2. Cross-Poisson per fixture from those ratings: λ_h = (h.atk/100) ×
   (a.def/100) × AVG_GOALS, λ_a similarly. 1.10× host bonus for
   USA/Canada/Mexico at home.
3. Model 1X2 from get_result_probs(home_goals, away_goals, boost).
4. If bet365 1X2 odds exist: de-vig (divide by overround) + linear
   blend at ODDS_BETA → adjusted 1X2 → find_inputs_for_probs to re-solve
   λs that produce the adjusted 1X2.
5. Downstream markets (CS, O1.5, O2.5, BTTS) from the final Poisson grid.
6. Write to fixture_projections (idempotent — DELETE comp=732 + INSERT).

Skipped: fixtures with unknown team rating (knockout bracket placeholders
like "1st Group A vs 3rd Group C/E/F/H/I").

After the fixture markets: a Monte Carlo tournament simulation, then
per-team stat projections (InternationalTeamStatService → team_projections), then
per-player stat projections (WcPlayerStatService → player_projections,
scoped to nations with a confirmed tournament_squads entry).
