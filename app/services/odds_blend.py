"""Bookmaker odds blending for goal projections.

Reels the model's expected goals (λ_h, λ_a) toward bookie expected goals
when bookie totals markets are priced. Replaces the older blend-in-
probability-space + 2D reverse-solve approach with a cleaner cascade
that exploits the goals over/under markets directly.

Cascade per fixture, per bookmaker (bet365 first, others as fallback):

  Path 1  per-team goals O/U ladders → fit each side's λ independently
  Path 1.5 single-team ladder + match total → derive missing side by subtraction
  Path 2  match total + 1X2 → fit match λ, reverse-solve share to match 1X2
  Path 3  match total only → fit match λ, split via model's per-team ratio
  Path 4  1X2 only → caller's existing reverse-solve (not handled here)
  Path 5  nothing → return None; caller leaves model unchanged

The caller blends our returned (λ_h_bookie, λ_a_bookie) with their model
output at the service-specific blend weight:

    λ_h_final = (1-w) * λ_h_model + w * λ_h_bookie

If we return None, the caller falls back to its existing 1X2-only path.

#
#   - Player odds are stored per book in `{book}_player_odds` tables
#     with columns (fixture_id, player_id, stats_type_id, stat_min,
#     price). All 5 books use the same column names.
#   - All player ladders are OVER-ONLY (no paired under). v1 uses raw
#     1/price as the implied probability — no margin stripping.
#   - Ladders are typically shallow (1+/2+/3+) so the probability filter
#     widens to (0.02, 0.90) — see fit_lambda_from_ladder.
#   - bet365 always leads the priority cascade per the global rule; the
#     cascade falls through per (fixture, player) row when bet365 has
#     no quote for that specific player.

# Player-prop ladders are over-only; this is the wider filter band
# passed to fit_lambda_from_ladder. Player ladders are shallow (1+/2+/3+)
# so the [0.10, 0.90] team-stat band drops most rungs; [0.02, 0.90]
# keeps "3+ goals for a striker" (~0.04) and "5+ tackles for a CDM"
# (~0.03) while still rejecting bookmaker stubs.
