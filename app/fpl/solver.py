"""
FPL squad-optimisation ILPs — the pure solver core for the on-demand endpoint.

Two entry points, both pure (no DB, no file I/O — the caller passes the fully
built input and gets the result dict back):

  solve_build(players, horizon, from_gw, season_id, budget, scope)
      Best legal squad from scratch by projected points over the horizon, with
      the recommended XI + captain each week. Backs gw1_draft / wildcard /
      freehit (freehit = horizon 1; wildcard = a manager's budget).

  solve_transfer(payload)
      Best set of transfers FROM an existing squad — owned players valued at
      their SELL price, others at BUY; budget = bank + squad sell value;
      objective = Σ(raw 6-GW xPts of the owned 15) − 4 × max(0, transfers − FT).
      Unbounded transfers/hits; taken only when they pay.

      RAW xPTS BY DESIGN (George, 2026-07-10): no per-week XI/bench modelling in
      transfer mode. A user's squad won't stay fixed for 6 weeks (transfers,
      injuries, forced starts), so best-XI-per-week precision was false
      precision — and raw totals are what every planner surface displays, so the
      move rows sum to the header exactly. Start-eligibility gates INCOMING
      players only (never recommend buying a non-starter); owned players count
      in full. Captaincy is display-only (top raw scorer per week), not scored.
      solve_build keeps the XI machinery — builds need a pitch to display.

Mirrors scripts/fpl/solve_squad.py + scripts/fpl/transfer_plan.py in the statz
repo (the dev/cron runners). Kept in sync by hand — same math, no CLI/JSON I/O.
