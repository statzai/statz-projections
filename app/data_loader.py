"""LeagueDataLoader — scoped per-league DB loader for projection runs.

Phase 2 skeleton (Direct DB Query Migration). Replaces the read paths of
DataCache for the 3 large tables (player_stats, team_stats, fixtures_df) by
querying only the rows needed for ONE league projection.

Scope (per `loader_scope_rules.md`):
  - team_ids = current + previous season squads of: target league + extras
    + league_above + league_below.
  - player_ids = players whose current_team_id ∈ team_ids.
  - team_fixture_ids = fixtures involving any team_id, last 2yr.
  - player_fixture_ids = fixtures any player_id appeared in, last 2yr —
    captures cross-club history (e.g. Marc Bernal's Barcelona stats while
    now at Palace) AND international stats (Saka for England).
  - fixture_ids = team_fixture_ids ∪ player_fixture_ids → drives
    fixtures_df so all merge keys resolve.

  Per-table scope:
  - fixtures_df: WHERE id IN fixture_ids (the union)
  - team_stats: WHERE fixture_id IN team_fixture_ids only — both teams'
    rows loaded (no team_id filter) so get_opp_stats sees opponents.
    Cross-club fixtures intentionally EXCLUDED — no projection path
    iterates team_stats for out-of-scope clubs.
  - player_stats: WHERE player_id IN player_ids AND fixture_id IN
    fixture_ids (union).

NOT YET WIRED IN. This file is a skeleton — Phase 3 adds shadow-mode hookup.

Output schema matches DataCache attribute-by-attribute (same column names,
same dedup keys, same fixtures_df bet365 LEFT JOIN, same team_ratings.Date
type) so projection services can swap source with no other changes.

        Two things changed 2026-04-30 vs the original Phase-2 design:

        1. Fixture scope = `self.fixture_ids` (UNION) NOT `self.team_fixture_ids`.
           The original comment claimed "no projection path reads team_stats
           from out-of-scope clubs" — wrong. `get_player_stats` does a per-row
           merge against `team_df` keyed on (fixture_id, team_id), where the
           team_id is whatever club the player was at for that fixture. For
           transferred players (Souza at Tottenham, history still at his old
           club) those rows fail to merge against in-league-scoped team_df and
           the share denominator collapses to 0 → NaN-guard fires, projection
           forced to 0.

        2. stats_type_id filter pulls only `TEAM_STAT_NAMES` (~13 of ~1,116
           stat types). Reduces ~70% of row volume — pays for the +cross-club
           rows from change #1 several times over.

        No `team_id` filter: get_opp_stats needs opposing-team rows.

        Why: FPL is Opta-sourced and considered authoritative for the stats
        it tracks. For stats Sportmonks ALSO has (xG, Tackles, Recoveries),
        we replace SM values with FPL where available — same definition,
        slightly more accurate. For stats Sportmonks LACKS (xA, combined CBI),
        we inject as new rows tagged with synthetic stats_type ids (see
        stats_types_synthetic_ids memory note).

        Stats applied here:
        - xG       (overlay onto SM 'Expected Goals (xG)')
        - xA       (inject as synthetic 'Expected Assists (xA)', id 999001)
        - Tackles  (overlay onto SM 'Tackles')
        - Recoveries (overlay onto SM 'Ball Recovery')
        - CBI      (inject as synthetic 'Clearances Blocks Interceptions
                    (FPL)', id 999002 — SM has 3 separate components but
                    no combined total; the components stay loaded for
                    other consumers, this row is just for the team-down
                    CBIT projection)

        Team-level totals are derived by summing player rows per
